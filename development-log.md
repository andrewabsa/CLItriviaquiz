## Production Log 1 - (13/07/2021)

So far, I have spent the bulk of my time researching and making most, if not all of the documentation. I started off with sketching up a flow chart on paper and then converted that into a digital format. I then made the software development plan starting with a list of my features. I have been keeping track of the progress of my project with the use of trello board and have already taken two screenshots. The implementation plan has been completed with prioritised steps, I also used the implementation plan to fill out most of my trello board.
More recently, I made the timer feature for my app using a while loop and created it's own function. Next on my list is to create the leaderboard and then move on to main bulk of the application.

I have finished making the main features of my app, although I did hit a roadblock in the process. My original timer feature that I had created was not functioning as i thought it would, so I simply changed this to a countdown timer to start the quiz instead making it much more achievable in the little time we have. The next thing for me to do is add some error handling and polish the code up a bit more. Then I will move on to the feature tests and then get start on the bash scripts. Finally, I should have enough time to write a comprehensive help file aswell.
