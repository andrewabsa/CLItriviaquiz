# Feature Tests

### Feature test #1

### Leaderboard: add_to_leaderboard:

- **Testing the add_to_leaderboard function**: The expected outcome will show that the leaderboard is now able to add and save names and scores. It will be able to open a seperate file and add the data to it. Saved names and scores will be on new line and seperated by commas.

**First scenario**: Check to see if leaderboard adds name and score to a file:
The add_to_leaderboard function succesfully accomplishes its task of retrieving a name and score value from the user and appending those values to the score.txt file, all entries are on new lines and are seperated by commas.

- **Testing the display_leaderboard function**: The expected output would be that the display_leaderboard function would open the same score.txt file and read and then print those contents to be displayed in the terminal.



### Leaderboard: display_leaderboard:


**Second scenario**: Run the program to see if the leaderboard displays all existing stored data: The display_leaderboard prints all existing name and score entries. 

### Summary
The leaderboard feature functions as it should. It successfully adds data to the leaderboard, and is able to display it in the terminal.
